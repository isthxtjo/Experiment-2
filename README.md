This is my Experiment #2 in Advanced Computer Programming!
This focuses on Numerical Phyton.

This Code contains to problems which is the Normalization Problem and the Divisible by 3 Problem.
In Normalization Problem, This section focuses on the centering and scaling of data using mean and standard deviation. The .mean() and .std() functions are the functions I used for calculations.

In Divisible By 3 Problem, A 10x10 array is created with the squares of the first 100 positive integers, followed by getting the numbers divisible by 3.
